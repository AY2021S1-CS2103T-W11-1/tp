--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **2. Setting up**

Refer to the guide [_Setting up and getting started_](SettingUp.md).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **3. Design**

### 3.1 Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="450" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App. Given below is a quick overview of each component.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:** The `.puml` files used to create diagrams in this document can be found in the [diagrams](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/docs/diagrams/) folder. Refer to the [_PlantUML Tutorial_ at se-edu/guides](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/plantUml.html) to learn how to create and edit diagrams.

</div>

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

Each of the four components,

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* exposes its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which implements the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component (see the class diagram given below) defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and exposes its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which implements the `Logic` interface.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 3.2 UI component

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)
_Diagram 3.2 : UI Class Diagram_

**API** :
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class.

The `UI` component uses JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.

### 3.3 Logic component

![Structure of the Logic Component](images/LogicClassDiagram.png)
_Diagram 3.3.1 : Delete Sequence Diagram_

**API** :
[`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

1. `Logic` uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command execution can affect the `Model` (e.g. adding a patient).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is passed back to the `Ui`.
1. In addition, the `CommandResult` object can also instruct the `Ui` to perform certain actions, such as displaying help to the user.

Given below is the Sequence Diagram for interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)
_Diagram 3.3.2 : Model Class Diagram_

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### 3.4 Model component

![Structure of the Model Component](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)
_Diagram 3.4 : Model Class Diagram_

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The `Model`,

* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences.
* stores the address book data.
* exposes an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* does not depend on any of the other three components.


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique `Tag`, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` object.<br>
![BetterModelClassDiagram](images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png)

</div>


### 3.5 Storage component

![Structure of the Storage Component](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)
_Diagram 3.5 : Storage Class Diagram_

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

The `Storage` component,
* can save `UserPref` objects in json format and read it back.
* can save the address book data in json format and read it back.

### 3.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **4. Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 4.1 Patient Commands
#### 4.1.1 Add Patient
#### 4.1.2 View Patient
#### 4.1.3 Delete Patient
#### 4.1.4 Edit Patient
#### 4.1.5 Find Patient
#### 4.1.6 List Patient

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
### 4.2 Appointment Commands
#### 4.2.1 Schedule Appointment
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `a-schedule` Command](images/ScheduleAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png)
###### Implementation
The implementation of scheduling an appointment has a similar execution as adding a patient (see 4.1.1).

The user's input is parsed by the `ScheduleAppointmentCommandParser` class which extends `Parser`, resulting in an `AppointmentScheduleCommand` which extends `Command`.
Subsequently, the `LogicManager` executes the `AppointmentScheduleCommand` object to schedule an appointment.

The `Appointment` class stores relevant fields (e.g. `AppointmentTime`, `Description`) and the `Patient`, **and/or** a string representing the patient's index in the `ObservableList<Patient>`, depending on which constructor was invoked on creation of an `Appointment` object.

#### Reason for design of implementation:
The reason for having 2 `Appointment` constructors is to improve the ease of scheduling an appointment by the user using the CLI.

To address the problem of mandatory fields being highly time-consuming, we have decided to allow users to simply input a `patientIndex` to identify the patient from the visible `ObservableList<Patient>` without being concerned with typing the exact name or details of the desired patient to assign to the `Appointment`.

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How `Patient` is stored in an `Appointment` object
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the `Patient` object and/or the `patientIndex` String
  * Pros: 
    * Easy to implement, gives a less stringent check for `isSameAppointment` for other Appointment-type commands (e.g. `AppointmentEditCommand`). 
    * This allows for creation of `Appointment` objects which are not duplicates yet have the same `Patient` and/or `patientIndex` during command execution.
  * Cons: More test cases necessary to ensure that `patientIndex` is correctly parsed and retrieved from patient list in `AddressBook`.

* **Alternative 2:** Saves only the `Patient` object after parsing the `patientIndex` String
  * Pros: No extra parsing/handling of `Patient` once `Appointment` object has been created.
  * Cons: Difficult to edit the patient-field in an `Appointment` object as all fields of the `Patient` object itself must be present.
  

#### 4.2.2 Delete Appointment

###### Implementation
The implementation of deleting an appointment has a similar execution as deleting a patient (see 4.1.3).

The user's input is parsed by the `DeleteAppointmentCommandParser` class which extends `Parser`, resulting in an `AppointmentDeleteCommand` which extends `Command`.
Subsequently, the `LogicManager` executes the `AppointmentDeleteCommand` object to delete the appointment with the given index in `ObservableList<Appointment>`.

#### 4.2.3 Edit Appointment

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `a-edit` Command](images/EditAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png)

###### Implementation
The implementation of editing an appointment has a similar execution as editing a patient (see 4.1.4).

The user's input is parsed by the `EditAppointmentCommandParser` class which extends `Parser`, resulting in an `AppointmentEditCommand` which extends `Command`.
Subsequently, the `LogicManager` executes the `AppointmentEditCommand` object to edit the appointment with the given index in `ObservableList<Appointment>`.

#### Reason for design of implementation:
The reason for having an `EditAppointmentDescriptor` is to enforce immutability by always creating the edited appointment as a new `Appointment` object.

#### Design consideration:

##### Aspect: How `Patient` is edited in an `Appointment` object
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Edits the `Patient` in the `Appointment` using a `patientIndex` String (e.g. `a-edit 1 pt/2`)
  * Pros: Easy for users to change the patient for the appointment using a single `patientIndex`.
  * Cons: `patientIndex` has to be carefully parsed and retrieved from a patient list that correctly reflects the patient list on the GUI.

* **Alternative 2:** Edits the `Patient` in the `Appointment` by `patientName` (e.g. `a-edit 1 pt/John Doe`)
  * Pros: None.
  * Cons: Greater difficulty for users to input the new `Patient` since the `patientName` may not be unique nor accurate to an existing patient in the patient list.
  

#### 4.2.4 Find Appointment (Patient)
![Sequence Diagram for commands with filter](images/AppointmentWithFilterCommand.png)
_Diagram 4.2.4 : Appointment Commands with Filters Sequence Diagram_

###### Implementation
The search for appointment by patient name works by filtering the appointment list to show only those appointments with
the given patient name.

The unique classes associated to this command as shown from Diagram 4.2.4 are :
1. `AppointmentWithFilterCommandParser: AppointmentFindPatientCommandParser`â€” Parses input arguments and creates a new AppointmentFindPatientCommand object.
1. `AppointmentFilter: SearchPatientFilter`â€” Checks if the appointment contains any patient which contains any keywords form the arguments.
1. `AppointmentWithFilterCommand: AppointmentFindPatientCommand`â€” Applies the filter to the appointment list.
#### 4.2.5 Find Appointment (Tag)
###### Implementation
The search for appointment by tags works by filtering the appointment list to show only those appointments with
the given tags.

The unique classes associated to this command as shown from Diagram 4.2.4 are :
1. `AppointmentWithFilterCommandParser: AppointmentTagCommandParser`â€” Parses input arguments and creates a new AppointmentTagCommand object.
1. `AppointmentFilter: SearchAppointmentTagsFilter`â€” Checks if the appointment contains any tags with the keywords form the arguments.
1. `AppointmentWithFilterCommand: AppointmentTagCommand`â€” Applies the filter to the appointment list.

##### Design considerations
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store the appointments by date added.
  * Pros: Easy to implement and less overhead operations when using adding appointments.
  * Cons: May not be the fastest way to search for appointments.

* **Alternative 2:** Store the appointments by tags and search the dates by Binary Search.
  * Pros: Search operation for this is faster.
  * Cons: Additional overhead every time you add an appointment as you need to know where to insert the command. 
  You also need to update the sequence of storage file by tag every time you schedule an appointment. In addition, 
  there might be a conflict for those appointments with more than one tags.

#### 4.2.6 Find Appointment (Today)
###### Implementation
The search for appointment by the current date works by filtering the appointment list to show only those appointments with
that occurs on the current day.

The unique classes associated to this command as shown from Diagram 4.2.4 are :
1. `AppointmentWithFilterCommandParser: AppointmentTodayCommandParser`â€” Creates a new AppointmentTodayCommand object.
1. `AppointmentFilter: SearchAppointmentTodayFilter`â€” Checks if the appointment occurs within the current day.
1. `AppointmentWithFilterCommand: AppointmentTodayCommand`â€” Applies the filter to the appointment list.
#### 4.2.7 Find Appointment (Current Week)
###### Implementation
The search for appointment by the current week works by filtering the appointment list to show only those appointments with
that occurs on the same week (Sunday to Saturday)

The unique classes associated to this command as shown from Diagram 4.2.4 are :
1. `AppointmentWithFilterCommandParser: AppointmentWeekCommandParser`â€” Creates a new AppointmentTodayCommand object.
1. `AppointmentFilter: SearchAppointmentWeekFilter`â€” Checks if the appointment occurs within the current week.
1. `AppointmentWithFilterCommand: AppointmentWeekCommand`â€” Applies the filter to the appointment list.

##### Design considerations
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store the appointments by date added.
  * Pros: Easy to implement and less overhead operations when using adding appointments.
  * Cons: May not be the fastest way to search for appointments.

* **Alternative 2:** Store the appointments by start date and search the dates by Binary Search.
  * Pros: Search operation for this will be faster.
  * Cons: Additional overhead every time you add an appointment as you need to know where to insert the command. 
  You also need to update the sequence of storage file every time you schedule an appointment.

#### 4.2.8 Complete Appointment

###### Implementation
Sets a specified appointment as completed.

The unique classes associated to this command as shown from Diagram 4.2.8 are :
1. `AppointmentCommandParser: AppointmentCompleteCommandParser`â€” Creates a new AppointmentCompleteCommand object.
1. `AppointmentCommand: AppointmentCompleteCommand`â€” Identifies the specified appointment from list and passes it to ModelManager to set as completed.

#### 4.2.9 List All Appointments

1. `AppointmentCommand: AppointmentListAllCommand`â€” Keeps appointment list unfiltered.

#### 4.2.10 List Appointments (Upcoming)

###### Implementation
Listing upcoming appointments works by filtering the appointment list to show only those appointments that are labelled as not completed and not missed.

The unique classes associated to this command as shown from Diagram 4.2.10 are :
1. `AppointmentWithFilterCommandParser: AppointmentListCommandParser`â€” Creates a new AppointmentListCommand object.
1. `AppointmentFilter: SearchAppointmentFilter`â€” Checks if appointments are both not completed and not missed.
1. `AppointmentWithFilterCommand: AppointmentListCommand`â€” Applies the filter to the appointment list.

#### 4.2.11 List Appointments (Completed)

###### Implementation
Listing completed appointments works by filtering the appointment list to show only those appointments that labelled as completed.

The unique classes associated to this command as shown from Diagram 4.2.11 are :
1. `AppointmentWithFilterCommandParser: AppointmentIsCompletedCommandParser`â€” Creates a new AppointmentIsCompletedCommand object.
1. `AppointmentFilter: SearchAppointmentCompletedFilter`â€” Checks if appointments are completed.
1. `AppointmentWithFilterCommand: AppointmentIsCompletedCommand`â€” Applies the filter to the appointment list.

#### 4.2.12 List Appointment (Missed)

###### Implementation
Listing missed appointments works by filtering the appointment list to show only those appointments that labelled as missed.

The unique classes associated to this command as shown from Diagram 4.2.12 are :
1. `AppointmentWithFilterCommandParser: AppointmentIsMissedCommandParser`â€” Creates a new AppointmentIsMissedCommand object.

1. `AppointmentWithFilterCommand: AppointmentIsMissedCommand`â€” Applies the filter to the appointment list.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4.3 General Commands
#### 4.3.1 Undo/redo feature

###### Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `UserHistoryManager`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally in `userHistory` as  `Stack<Pair<List<Patient>, List<Appointment>>>`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `UserHistoryManager#addHistory()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `UserHistoryManager#undoHistory()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `UserHistoryManager#redoHistory()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `ModelManager` class as `ModelManager#getUserHistoryManager()`, `ModelManager#undoHistory()` and `Model#redoHistory()` respectively.

<!-- 
//I commented out the UML diagrams as I did not use the same design the AB3. Will design my own diagram in later commits.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step. 

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th patient in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new patient. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the patient was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![CommitActivityDiagram](images/CommitActivityDiagram.png)
--->

##### Reason for design of implementation:
The reason for the design of userHistory using a stack is due to the functionality of `undoHistory()`. We want to be able undo the latest changes to the `UniquePatientList` or `UniqueAppointmentList`.
This follows the `Last In,First Out(LIFO)` design which can be implementated using the `stack` data structure.

A concern using this design is that the memory usage might be undesirable due to the large of memory usage needed to store every user history at each command.
However, after many test runs, we concluded that the memory usage of the user history was insignificant and thus this design can be safely implememented with no drawbacks.

##### Design consideration:

###### Aspect: How undo & redo executes

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the patient being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
  
* **Alternative 3:** Individual command is contained in a `reversible-pair-action` class. When we want to `undo`, we can just call its `pair command`.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (due to the fact that are not saving any additional data).
  * Cons: Very difficult to implement, some commands might not have `pair command`(e.g for `edit`, it is own pair command but pair command to call for undo is hard to implement).
