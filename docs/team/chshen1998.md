## Project: Archangel

Archangel is an appointment management system designed for Psychiatrists. The project simulates an ongoing software
 project written in Java for a desktop application (called Archangel) used for managing appointment thru a CLI and a GUI
 built using JavaFX. It is written in OOP fashion. It provides a reasonably well-written code base bigger (around 6 KLoC) than what
students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
It comes with a reasonable level of user and developer documentation.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the basic function for viewing appointments in the AddressBook - listall appointment command.
